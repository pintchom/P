# RECEIVER CODE
# Make sure there is a device set up as a SENDER that is connecting to the same
# advertisement.complete_name that you see below. This example has
# advertisement.complete_name = "profg-r" but you should change that to whatever
# you set your receiver_name equal to in the code.py file on your SENDER CPB.
# This code will receive messages from touchpads on the SENDER CPB
# Pressing a CPB touchpad: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or TX - will send  a similarly indexed
# ButtonPacket for the first 7 buttons listed in the list named
# bluefruit_buttons, below: ButtonPacket.BUTTON_1 through 4, UP, DOWN, and LEFT).
# Pressing Button_A on the SENDER CPB will send the 8th bluefruit_buttons, ButtonPacket.RIGHT.
# When any of the pads or Button_A are released, a ColorPacket of color (0, 0, 0) is sent
# and the code below will use that packet to turn the lights turn off.
# Pressing Button_B on the SENDER CPB will allow the user to input text in the serial console
# and press return to send it. The text that is sent will print in the serial console of the RECEIVER
# if its code is running in Mu & the serial console is open.
